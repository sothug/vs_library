# VScript Library (HLVR)
[![ver][]](CHANGELOG.txt)

[ver]: https://img.shields.io/badge/vs__library-v0.1.2-informational

The scope and structure of this library is tailored for Half-Life Alyx and its addon system.

The issues with the system is talked about in [this Steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2187633818).

This also fixes the a1_intro_world transition issue.

## Installation

1. Download [vs_library.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samisalreadytaken/vs_library/hlvr/vs_library.lua).

2. Place `vs_library.lua` in your addon vscripts directory `/steamapps/common/Half-Life Alyx/game/hlvr_addons/<addonid>/scripts/vscripts/`

3. Rename the file name to something unique. I suggest adding the version number to the end of the file. For example version 0.1.0 file name becomes `vs_library-010.lua`.

This renaming will ensure different versions of the library can exist in the server at the same time. File name does not matter as long as it is unique, as the version control is done inside the library, and not dependant on lua packages.

## Usage

```lua
local VS = require "vs_library-010"
```

## Includes

### Constants

```
VS.MAX_COORD_FLOAT
VS.MAX_TRACE_LENGTH
VS.DEG2RAD
VS.RAD2DEG
VS.PI
VS.RAND_MAX
```

### Functions

```cpp
bool VS.OnPlayerSpawn(closure callback [, string|closure|nil error [, params ...]])
```

Execute `callback` on player spawn. Optionally print string `error` or execute function `error` on failure. Optionally pass arbitrary amount of parameters to `callback`.

`callback` can return `nil` or `true` to indicate successful execution, or `false` for failure, in which case the function will keep being executed every second for the next 10 seconds after player spawn. After this time ends and callback has not returned success, `error` will be printed.

Only one event can be added from each file to avoid duplications.

*Example:*

```lua
local function Init(p1)

	if InitialiseScript(p1) then
		return true
	end

	return false

end
```

```lua
VS.OnPlayerSpawn(Init)
```

```lua
VS.OnPlayerSpawn(Init, nil, 1)
```

```lua
VS.OnPlayerSpawn(Init, "failed to initialise script", 1)
```
